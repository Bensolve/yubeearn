## Things to Check in Firebase

After signup, check Firebase Console:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Click **"Firestore Database"**
4. Look for **"users"** collection
5. Should see new document:
```
   {
     email: "creator1@test.com",
     userType: "creator",
     balance: 0,
     tasksCompleted: 0,
     createdAt: (timestamp)
   }
```

## Troubleshooting - What Could Go Wrong

### Error 1: "Redirect loop"
- **Cause:** Role check failing
- **Fix:** Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

### Error 2: "Page not found"
- **Cause:** File structure issue
- **Fix:** Check all files moved correctly

### Error 3: "User not found"
- **Cause:** Firebase not saving user
- **Fix:** Check Firebase has Firestore DB created

### Error 4: "Unexpected any" error
- **Cause:** TypeScript errors in component
- **Fix:** Replace `any` with proper types

### Error 5: Sidebar doesn't show creator links
- **Cause:** `SidebarCreator` component issue
- **Fix:** Check component is imported correctly
